# AI-Powered Student Performance Prediction

## Domain: Education

## Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: React (MERN Stack)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Machine Learning**: Python (for implementing ML models)

---

## Description:
A web application designed to predict student performance based on historical academic data using advanced machine learning algorithms. The platform provides actionable insights and predictive analytics for educational institutions.

---

## Objective:
To identify at-risk students and provide timely interventions, ensuring better academic outcomes and student success.

---

## Targeted Outcomes:
1. **Predictive Analytics**: Utilize machine learning models to forecast student performance accurately.
2. **Data Visualization**: Provide insightful dashboards with visual representations of student data and predictions.
3. **Personalized Interventions**: Recommend tailored strategies for students based on prediction results.
4. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate detailed reports for educators, parents, and stakeholders.
5. **Integration with Educational Tools**: Seamlessly connect with existing learning management systems (LMS) and other educational technologies.

## Python Code Implementation:

### 1. Data Preprocessing and Model Training
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import joblib

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('student_data.csv')

# Handle missing values
data = data.dropna()

# Separate features and target variable
X = data.drop('performance', axis=1)
y = data['performance']
